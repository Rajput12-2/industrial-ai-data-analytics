# industrial-ai-data-analytics
Internship project showcasing Industrial AI &amp; Data Analytics skills through production data analysis, defect detection, visualization, and actionable recommendations.

# 📘 Internship Project – Industrial AI & Data Analytics

## 📂 Project Overview
This repository contains my **internship project** on Industrial AI & Data Analytics.  
The goal of this project is to analyze real-world production data, identify quality issues, and provide actionable insights for improving manufacturing efficiency.  
The project involves data cleaning, visualization, and insights generation using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📊 Key Insights
- ✅ **Morning shift** shows the highest production.  
- ⚠️ **Evening shift** needs stronger quality control.  
- 🏭 **Machine M-103** has the maximum defects → requires preventive maintenance.  
- 🌡️ **Defects increase above ~182°C**, showing the importance of temperature control.  
- ⏱️ **Optimal cycle time is 15–16 minutes** for efficiency and lower defects.
